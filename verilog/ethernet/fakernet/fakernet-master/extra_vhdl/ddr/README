Code should use entities:

efnet_hw_iddr
efnet_hw_oddr
efnet_hw_iddr_vector
efnet_hw_oddr_vector

for single (std_logic) or vector (std_logic_vector).

Those entities are then furnished by including the necessary sources,
depending on what entity is available by hardware.

Either efnet_hw_{i,o}ddr_vector is used to provide a vector version
from single-channel hardware version, or efnet_hw_{i,o}ddr_single (to
be implemented) from vector hardware version.
